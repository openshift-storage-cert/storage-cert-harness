# 0009. Scoped setup: run / group / individual

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-24

## Context

Separate virtbench scenario integrations share an SSH helper pod. Per-job
provision/teardown would repeatedly recreate it and cannot own shared cleanup.

## Decision

- Add registered `stages.SetupProvider`s with `SetupInfo{Scope, Key}`,
  `Setup(ctx, rc, trs)`, and `Teardown(ctx, rc, trs)`. Deduplicate providers by
  `(scope, key)`.
- **Run scope** receives all runnable TRs. **Group scope** receives runnable TRs
  whose tools list its key in `ToolIntegration.SetupGroups`; activate it only
  when at least one such TR exists.
- After selection, set up active providers once in **run → group** order, execute
  tool jobs, then tear down successful providers once in reverse **group → run**
  order. Providers obtain configuration from their in-scope TRs/run context.
- Failed setup emits error verdicts for affected TRs and prevents their jobs
  from running. Do not call teardown on a provider whose setup failed.
- **Individual scope** remains `Provisioner`, once per tool job with that job's
  TRs; it needs no new mechanism.

## Decision notes

### Options considered

- **Scoped providers (chosen):** explicit shared ownership and cleanup timing;
  require a small core lifecycle addition.
- **Idempotent per-job creation:** still recreates resources between jobs.
- **Collapsed scenarios:** breaks the exact registry-key contract.

### Consequences

virtbench's `virtbench` group provider creates the `ssh-test-pod` only if absent
and deletes it only if it created it. Replay skips shared cluster setup.
Expensive shared images, RBAC, or operators should use providers instead of
per-job work. virtbench's own `--cleanup` handles its workload namespaces.

A first-class kubeconfig field and in-cluster execution remain outside scope.
