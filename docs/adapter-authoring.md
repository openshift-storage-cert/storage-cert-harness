# Authoring a tool integration

A tool integration is a Go package under `internal/tools/<tool>/` that registers
a `ToolIntegration`. This is designed so a tool decomposes into several small,
independently-ownable tasks — great for parallel work.

## Steps

1. **Copy the reference.** `cp -r internal/tools/example internal/tools/<tool>`
   and rename the package.

2. **Declare the integration** in `init()`:

   ```go
   registry.Register(stages.ToolIntegration{
       Name:     "<tool>",
       Image:    "quay.io/<vendor>/<tool>:<tag>", // the tool's RELEASED image
       Provides: []string{"<TR-id>", ...},        // TR ids from catalog.json
       Provisioner:  provisioner{},
       Runner:       runner{},
       LogCollector: collector{},
       ResultParser: parser{},
       Teardown:     teardown{},
       // Optional: Preflight, Evaluators (custom per-TR scoring),
       // ParallelSafe + ExclusivityGroups (scheduling defaults).
   })
   ```

3. **Implement only the stages you need.** Each is a small interface (see
   `internal/stages`). Reuse shared adapters where they exist. Every method gets
   `context.Context` (honor cancellation) and a `*core.Bag`.

4. **Use the Bag for cross-stage state** and document its keys at the top of the
   package (see the `example` package header):
   - Provision writes what Run/Collect/Teardown need (namespace, release name…).
   - Read with `core.GetAs[string](bag, "namespace")`.

   For the active storage array, read `rc.Backend` (a `*core.ResolvedBackend`,
   may be nil): `rc.Backend.StorageClass`, `rc.Backend.Param("svm")`, and
   `rc.Backend.Secret("password")`. **Never log or serialize secret values.** If
   your tool requires a backend, assert it in `Preflight` and emit an `error`
   finding when it is missing.

5. **Write a golden-file test for the parser.** Put a captured sample of the
   tool's output under `testdata/`, parse it, and compare to a golden file
   (`example_test.go` is the template; `go test ./... -update` regenerates). This
   needs no cluster.

6. **Emit results the grader can score.** Your `ResultParser` returns one
   `TestResult` per TR (keyed by `TRID`):
   - For **SLAs**: append `core.Metric{Name, Value, Unit, Percentile}` — the
     grader matches each `sla` by metric name (and percentile when set) and
     compares against the thresholds value. You emit measurements only; the bar
     lives in `thresholds.json`.
   - For **checks**: set `TestResult.Checks[<checkID>]` to the tool's native
     `Outcome` for each `capability`/`suite`/`scenario` check. `manual` checks
     are never yours to score.
   - When a TR's scoring doesn't reduce to these rules, add an `Evaluator` to
     the integration's `Evaluators` map keyed by that TR id — it fully owns the
     TR's verdicts.

7. **Compile it in.** Add one blank import to `cmd/harness/main.go`:

   ```go
   _ "gitlab.cee.redhat.com/eco-special-projects/storage-cert-harness/internal/tools/<tool>"
   ```

8. **Verify:** `make unittest && ./bin/harness list` should show your tool and
   `run --tool <tool>` should exercise it.

## Multi-scenario tools = a scenario table

Some tools expose several subcommands, each mapping to a different TR and (often)
a different output shape — virtbench is the reference (`internal/tools/virtbench`,
ADR-0008). Don't copy the package per subcommand. Instead:

- Keep one generic `engine.go` with the stage plumbing (preflight, provision,
  exec, collect, teardown, replay), parameterized over a `Scenario`.
- Put a `Scenario` table in `scenario.go`: each row carries the
  `automation_tool` string (the registry key), the TR it provides, the result
  file, a `BuildArgs` closure, and a **pluggable `Parse` closure**. `init()`
  loops the table and registers one `ToolIntegration` per row.
- A metric-map scenario is a new row + fixture; a differently-shaped output is a
  new row + a new `Parse` closure. If either forces an `engine.go` edit, that's
  the signal the engine isn't generic enough yet — generalize it and note what
  leaked.

**Units:** emit each metric in whatever unit the tool reports (e.g. seconds); the
grader normalizes units before comparing to the gate (ADR-0008), so you never
convert to the SLA's unit yourself.

**SLAs your run can't measure** (a percentile the tool doesn't emit, a metric
from another subsystem, a scale you didn't run): declare them via a per-scenario
`Applicable(sla)` predicate consulted in the tool's `Evaluator`, which skips them
with a reason and delegates the rest to `grader.GradeSLAs`/`grader.GradeChecks`.
This yields an explained `skip` instead of a spurious `error`, and keeps the core
grader tool-agnostic.

## Setup that's shared across tests (run / group scope)

The `Provisioner` stage runs once per tool-job (individual scope). For setup that
must happen **once per run** or **once for a batch of tests that share it**, use a
`stages.SetupProvider` instead of repeating work per job (ADR-0009):

- Implement `SetupInfo() {Scope, Key}`, `Setup(ctx, rc, trs)`,
  `Teardown(ctx, rc, trs)`. Scope is `stages.ScopeRun` (once per run) or
  `stages.ScopeGroup` (once per named group).
- `registry.RegisterSetup(&yourSetup{})` in `init()` (dedup is by `(scope,key)`,
  so registering the same group from several tool packages is safe).
- Each tool that depends on a group lists it in
  `ToolIntegration.SetupGroups: []string{"<key>"}`.
- The orchestrator runs `Setup` once (run → group) before the job loop and
  `Teardown` once in reverse after all jobs; a failed `Setup` errors its in-scope
  TRs instead of running them. Make `Setup` idempotent (create-if-absent) and only
  tear down what you created.

virtbench is the reference: all its scenarios share one `ssh-test-pod` helper via
a group provider (`internal/tools/virtbench/setup.go`), so a batch of virtbench
tests creates it once and removes it once. Skip shared setup in replay mode
(no cluster).

## When there's no released image

Add a `Containerfile` to the tool package and set `Image` to where you publish
it. This is the exception, not the rule (ADR-0003).
