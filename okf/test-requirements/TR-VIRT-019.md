# TR-VIRT-019: Parallel VM Lifecycle at Progressive Scale

## Summary

Progressive-scale parallel VM lifecycle via the upstream
[virt-parallel](../workloads/virt-parallel.md) workload. Each iteration creates
N VMs with DataVolumes, resizes volumes, restarts VMs, snapshots, migrates from
a random node, and deletes all — then increments N by the configured step. Runs
until failure or `max-iterations` reached.

## Target SLA (draft)

Key metrics under evaluation (not yet gated in harness):

- Per-operation latency at each scale tier (create, resize, restart, snapshot, migrate)
- Maximum sustainable VM count before failure
- Storage backend throughput under concurrent resize + snapshot + migration I/O

Acceptable latency limits are **to-be-validated**.

## Risk & failure modes

- Cascading failures when parallel VM operations overwhelm virt-controller or CDI
- Storage backend collapse under concurrent resize + snapshot + migration I/O
- Migration QPS limits exceeded causing queue backup and timeouts
- Resource fragmentation preventing VM placement at higher scale tiers
- Non-linear latency degradation (fast at 5 VMs, fails at 50)

## Harness integration

- Catalog entry: `automation_tool: kube-burner-ocp`, `sla_count: 0`
- Plan param `workload: virt-parallel` selects the subcommand
- Native grading: all kube-burner jobs `passed` ([jobs_passed](../output-schema/harness-parsed-metrics.md))
- Example plans: [tr-virt-019-parallel-vm-lifecycle](../plans/tr-virt-019-parallel-vm-lifecycle.md) (progressive),
  [smoke](../plans/tr-virt-019-parallel-vm-lifecycle-smoke.md) (2 VMs, 1 iter)

## Cluster prerequisites

- OpenShift Virtualization (KubeVirt CRD)
- CDI (DataVolume CRD)
- VolumeSnapshotClass on the backend storage class (required for snapshot phase)
- ≥ 3 schedulable worker nodes (required for migration phase)
